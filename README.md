# Spring Data JDBC how to examples
collection of how to example to show how to implement specific UC

### Guides
The following project illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Spring Data JDBC documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/jdbc.html)

## package: it.spaghettisource.springdatajdbc.howto.idStrategy

the scope of this package is to show how to use the standard repository to interact with flat entity (no inner beans) and use it 
to show the different strategies applicable to manage the ID for the aggregate ROOT and show the Entity State Detection Strategies:

* show how to use the DB to automatically generate the entity's id
* show how create manually the entity's id by the application for NEW entity instead that rely on the DB's ID auto generated
* show how determine by the application if execute and INSERT or an UPDATE and the manage manually the ID
* show how the versioning drive the INSERT or an UPDATE of an entity

this example analyze the aspects of the 
[ID Generation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/jdbc/entity-persistence.html#entity-persistence.id-generation) and the [Entity State Detection Strategies](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/relational/reference/repositories/core-concepts.html#is-new-state-detection)
described in the  official documentation

The detection strategy "Providing a custom EntityInformation implementation" is not analyzed in this examples

### test: SimpleCrudAutoIdTest

a simple case that show how to create a flat entity and create the related repository.
The interaction with the repository is based on the default method automatically generated.
In this example the ID of the entity are generated automatically by the DB 

### test: SimpleCrudTestsManualIdByCallBackTest

this example show how generate the ID of the entity by application code for the NEW entity. 
It uses the BeforeConvertCallback to generate the ID.  
By this solution it is still Spring that is responsible to determine if execute INSERT or UPDATE

### test: SimpleCrudTestsManualIdByPersistableInterfaceTest

Using the Persistable interface we leverage Spring-Data from the responsibility to determine if execute INSERT or UPDATE
Then we can set manually the ID of the entity and force Spring Data to do an INSERT instead that an UPDATE

Important Note to remember: Properties of Persistable will get detected and persisted if you use AccessType.PROPERTY. To avoid that, use @Transient.

### test: SimpleCrudVersionedTest

Despite the @Version annotation it is not used strictly related to the ID generation, if effect the behaviour of Spring-Data. 
In fact when an Entity has a field annotated wit @Version, 
Spring determine if execute INSERT or UPDATE not more over an ID but it is driven by the Version attribute,
This example has the scope to make it in practise and show the behaviour under this condition. 
To keep the test simple, it used the ID autogenerated.

Important Note to remember: Is it possible exploit all the power of Spring combining strategy's together, 
for example using the @Version annotation and implementing Persistable in the way to drive when to make INSERT or UPDATE
